# SOF language support

A small Visual Studio Code extension that defines syntax highlighting grammar for the SOF programming language. The language itself is an open-source project by kleinesfilmr√∂llchen and [can be found here](https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/sof-language). Contributions to both the language and this syntax highlighter are welcome.

## Extension Settings
